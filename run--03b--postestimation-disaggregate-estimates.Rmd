### Disaggregate Estimates by Age Group

Our strategy to disaggregate estimates by age group--primarily to break our estimates for ages 0-5 into 0-2 and 3-5--is to take the empirical age breakdown specific to each outcome, from the ACS 1-year data. 

```{r calculate outcome-specific age breakdowns}

           age_3to5 = between(AGEP, 3, 5),
           age_0    = AGEP == 0,
           age_1    = AGEP == 1,
